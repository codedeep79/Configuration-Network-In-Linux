## 1. Network configuration on Ubuntu 17.10 and newer
### 1.1. Configure a Static IP Address with Netplan
 Open the network config file with an editor:

 ```
 sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
 ```
 
 Here is an example for a static IPv4 address **192.168.1.100** on the first network interface **ens33** and gateway IP **192.168.1.1** . The server will use the free Google DNS servers **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4** to for name resolving.
 
 ```
 # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
```

An IPv6 address can be added in the **addresses** line, separated by a comma. Example:

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.100/24, '2001:1::1/64']
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]

```

It is important that you wrap the IPv6 address into single quotes, you will get a syntax error otherwise.

To apply the changes, run:

```
sudo netplan apply
```

Or use it with the --debug switch to get some useful output if parsing of the netplan config file was successful.

```
sudo netplan --debug apply
```
### 1.2. Configure a DHCP address with Netplan

Here is the configuration to get the network configuration for IPv4 and IPv6 from a DHCP server.

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
 version: 2
 renderer: networkd
 ethernets:
   ens33:
     dhcp4: yes
     dhcp6: yes
```

To apply the changes, run:

```
sudo netplan apply
```

### 1.3. More Netplan config options
Netplan is a complex new configuration system to configure network cards, virtual devices, VLANs and bridges in Ubuntu 17.10. For more examples and an in depth explanation of the syntax, see the [main page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man5/netplan.5.html).
