## Prerequisites

+ A server running Ubuntu 16.04.
+ A non-root user with sudo privileges setup on your server.
+ A static IP address 192.168.0.187 setup on your server.

## Getting Started

Lets start by updating your system to the latest stable version. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
After updating system, you will need to set proper fully qualified domain name. You can do this by editing /etc/hosts file:

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Add the following line:

```
192.168.0.187 server.opennms.local server
```

Next, open the /etc/hostname file:

```
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
Add the following line:

```
server.opennms.local
```
Save the file when you are finished, then restart your system to apply these changes.
## Install PostgreSQL

OpenNMS requires the PostgreSQL for database purpose. You can install PostgreSQL by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql -y
```
After installing PostgreSQL, you will need to allow user access to the database. PostgreSQL only allows you to connect if you are logged in to the local account name that matches the PostgreSQL user. Since OpenNMS runs as root, so you will need to change the configuration to allow root user.

You can do this by editing pg_hba.conf file.

```
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf
```
Find the following lines:

```
local   all         all                                         local
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32                    md5
host    all         all         ::1/128                         md5
```

And, change them to look like the following:

```
local   all         all                                          trust
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32                     trust
host    all         all         ::1/128                          trust
```

Save and close the file when you are finished, then restart the PostgreSQL service and enable it to start on boot with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

Once you are done, you can proceed to install Java.


## Install Java

OpenNMS doesn't support Java 8 yet, It is strongly recommended to use Java 7. To install Java 7, you will need to add PPA to the apt source list. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer -y
```

```
sudo jave -version
```

```
java version "1.7.0_101"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
```
